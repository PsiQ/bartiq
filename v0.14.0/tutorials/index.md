# Introduction

We currently have three tutorials for `bartiq`:

- [Basic example](01_basic_example.ipynb)
- [Alias Sampling basic](02_alias_sampling_basic.ipynb)
- [Advanced examples](03_advanced_examples.ipynb)

They have been designed to gradually introduce you to the concepts we use in `bartiq`, so we recommend to go through them in order.
