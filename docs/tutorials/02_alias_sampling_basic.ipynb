    "The example we used in previous tutorial was nice to establish some basic terminology. But let's be honest, it was contrived and not very practical. So now we'll take an existing example from a paper and try to get some resource estimations for it using `bartiq`!\n",
    "\n",
    "For that we'll use Alias Sampling—an algorithm proposed by Babbush et al. in [Encoding Electronic Spectra in Quantum Circuits with Linear T Complexity](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.041015). This is what the circuit looks like:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It comes from Fig. 11 from the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "This circuit is an important subroutine in the paper's larger algorithm because it is responsible for preparing arbitrary quantum states, which can be thought of as \"loading\" data into the quantum computer."

    "In this tutorial we won't be explaining how the algorithm works in details—partly because this is not the place, and partly because [Craig Gidney already did it in his blogpost](https://algassert.com/post/1805)\n",
    "\n",
    "But briefly and at a high level, Alias Sampling contains the following subroutines:\n",
    "- $\\textrm{UNIFORM}_L$: prepares a state which is a uniform superposition over $L$ basis states\n",
    "- $H^{\\otimes\\mu}$: applies a set of Hadamard gates to create a uniform superposition over $2^{\\mu}$ basis states\n",
    "- QROM: loads data values into two \"data\" registers in superposition depending on the state input to $\\textrm{In}_{\\ell}$\n",
    "- Comparator: flips a target qubit if $\\textrm{keep}_l \\leq \\sigma_l$ based on the values of the two other input registers (to $\\textrm{In}_{\\sigma_l}$ and $\\textrm{In}_{\\textrm{keep}_l}$ respectively).\n",
    "- Controlled SWAP: swaps two target registers conditional on the value of a control qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, before we map all these subroutines to `bartiq`, it would be good to know what the costs of each of the subroutines are. After carefully reading the paper we can deduce what the costs are. But before we get there, let's define our symbols to have consistent naming.  The authors use same letters for different variables in different figures, so it can get confusing without reading the paper carefully—that's why we'll stick to the naming from the figure above to keep things simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $L$ – number of coefficients we want to load.\n",
    "- $\\mu$ – bits of precision for coefficients we load.\n",
    "- $k$ is the greatest common factor of $L$. This is not a widely-used mathematical operation, but fortunately in `bartiq` we have a shorthand for that, and we can say that `k = multiplicity(2, L)`. For more information, you can check how [it's defined in sympy](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/ntheory.html#sympy.ntheory.factor_.multiplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given all that—what are the costs of our routines? For the purpose of we shall focus on just calculating the T-gate and rotation costs: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Uniform: $8\\log_2(L/k)$ T-gates and 2 rotation gates. It comes Fig 12 and its caption. We omit the $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon)$ term, because it corresponds to those two rotations that we count separately.\n",
    "- Hadamards: No T-gates or rotations.\n",
    "- QROM: $4L-4$ – this comes from Fig. 10.\n",
    "- Comparator: $4\\mu-4$ – this is not stated explicitly in the text, but comes from a careful analysis of the caption of Fig. 11.\n",
    "- Swap: $O(\\log_2(L))$ – this is not stated explicitly in the text, but comes from a careful analysis of the caption of Fig. 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "These expressions don't take into account some nuances—for example the uniform state preparation (USP) can be implemented as a layer of Hadamard gates if $L$ is a power of two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with this knowledge, we can now write each individual routine.\n",
    "However, since in this case all the routines have similar structure, we can use the following helper function:"

That's not the case though and if there are any mistakes or oversimplifications—please let us know! However, the fact that even a relatively simple routine presents such challenges, shows that we need better tools for working with quantum algorithms.\n",
