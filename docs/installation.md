# Installation

## Basic

To install `bartiq` run: `pip install bartiq`.

In order to install it from source clone the repo by running `git clone git@github.com:PsiQ/qref.git` and then run `pip install .` from the main directory.

```bash
# Clone bartiq repo (you can use HTTP link as well)
git clone git@github.com:PsiQ/bartiq.git
cd bartiq
pip install .
```

## Development

For development we recommend using `poetry`. In order to install all the dev dependencies using poetry please run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:PsiQ/bartiq.git
cd bartiq
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

This should install all the dev and docs dependencies.
