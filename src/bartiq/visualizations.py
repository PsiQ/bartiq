    """Get the dataframe with unique routine names ready to be plotted.

    Certain routine names may appear more than once in a
    ``CompiledRoutine``. These are not easily handled by ``plotly`` because
    it cannot work out redundant routine names as well as parent-child
    relations for redundant names.

    This method applies a renaming based on the input dataframe such that
    each new definition of a routine whose name already exists is renamed.
    The new name is the original routine name folowed by an underscore
    separator and a numerical counter.

    Note: this method assumes that the data in the dataframe are ordered.
    This is used to determine new parent data. Specficially, each time a
    routine is defined with a certain name, any following row in the
    dataframe that contains this routine as its parent will (of course) be
    mapped to that particular routine as a child. Due to the renaming
    described above, the parent entry of new row is also renamed to the
    latest unique name that was created based on an input routine name.

    For example: assume that "routine1" has been defined and "routine1" is
    redefined once again. This method will rename the new routine to
    "routine1_2" and any subsequent rows marking "routine1" as a parent
    will also be changed such that they mark "routine1_2" as a parent.

    Args:
